# SWAT Group Hackathon 2025 - Team Runtime Terror

## Getting Started
1. Open a terminal in both `client` and `api` (assuming you want to run both)
2. Follow their READMEs to get things up and running
3. If you want to open VS Code at the root of the repo and develop in both, make sure to open the workspace included in the repo (`SWAT Group Hackathon 2025 - Runtime Terror.code-workspace`)
    - If you do not, Biome will not work
